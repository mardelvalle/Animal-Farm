# Animal Farm
On click each animal will move to a random spot on the screen. While doing so they will make a sound.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery

For each animal I game an on.click method which would randomize a value in a specific range for the x and y access. next I created  a variable which connected to the audio of the project. Which was then told to move and activate the audio.

## Lessons Learned:

This was good practice in research and finding a variety of codes which could serve as good reference. This project is a strong demonstration of my ability to work independently to make a project.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
